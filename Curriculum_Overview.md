# 5-Year Mastery Curriculum: The Orator-Engineer

## 1. Objective
To forge a world-class speaker, actor, and debater from the raw material of a Software Engineer. This curriculum fuses the rigor of **Classical Rhetoric**, the truthfulness of **Method Acting**, and the agility of **Competitive Debate**. The goal is not just to "present well" but to command any room, inhabit any role, and dismantle any argument with precision and grace.

## 2. Core Philosophy: Active Output
- **80/20 Rule:** 80% Performance/Drills, 20% Theory/Analysis.
- **The "Boss Assignment":** No progression without demonstrating mastery.
- **The "Random Page Ritual":** The non-negotiable daily anchor.
