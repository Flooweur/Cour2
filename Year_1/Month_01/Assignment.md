# Year 1, Month 1: Boss Assignment
## "The Neutral Manifest"

**Objective:** To speak for 3 minutes with zero unintentional movement.

**The Challenge:**
1. Choose a technical paragraph from a software documentation (e.g., Kubernetes docs) or a legal text. It must be "dry".
2. Set up a camera recording your full body (head to toe).
3. Stand in "Neutral Position":
   - Feet hip-width apart.
   - Knees soft (unlocked).
   - Spine long.
   - Arms hanging loosely by sides.
4. Recite the text aloud.
5. **The Fail Condition:** If you shift your weight, scratch your nose, fix your hair, or use a "compensatory gesture" (hand waving without purpose), you fail.

**Submission:**
- Record until you have a clean take.
- Watch the take. Write a 1-page analysis of where you felt tension (Jaw? Lower back? Hands?).

**Why?**
You cannot build a character or an argument until you can control your own baseline. This teaches you to inhibit the "noise" of your body.
